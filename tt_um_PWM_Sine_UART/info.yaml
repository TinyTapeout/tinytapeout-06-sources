project:
  title:        "PWM_Sinewave_UART"      # Project title
  author:       "Luis Gerardo Avila"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "This project is a PWM signal generator that creates a sine wave, with frequency variation between 100 Hz and 700 Hz with steps of 100 in 100 Hz, which is manipulated through a UART interface"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     25000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
