# Locking a design using Moosic and TinyTapeout

![My Image](blog/locking.svg)

Logic locking is a way to secure silicon chips against supply chain attacks.
We wrote a Yosys plugin, [Moosic](https://github.com/Coloquinte/moosic-yosys-plugin), to apply logic locking solutions easily using a fully open source toolchain.

This is a showcase design to show how to apply logic locking on a simple example.
It uses [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) to go all the way to a silicon chip!
Have a look at the [blog post](https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/logic-locking-with-moosic/) on the YosysHQ blog for more information.
