  description:  "This device is a 3-bit ALU that generates 5 operations in parallel. The operations that the ALU performs are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo operation. The device has 2 inputs; A[3-bit] and B[3-bit] along with a 3-bit selector (Selector[3-bit]). It also has a single 6-bit output (OutPut[6-bit]). In the end, the design entails 15 pins in total; 9 input and 6 output pins. The operation of this ALU is simple: At input A and B, the values ​​are set using switches, for example, A= 111 and B=101. To obtain the 5 different results through the different 5 operations that the ALU performs, the 3-bit selector (Selector[3-bits]) is used, therefore, using 3 switches we will place the result that we want to observe at the output." # One line description of what your project does
